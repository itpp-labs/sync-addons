======================
 Telegram Integration
======================

With this module you can create a Telegram bot to communicate with people through Odoo.

For each telegram user, the module creates a partner with corresponding information (name, nickname, avatar).

Roadmap
=======

* Docs: cover all functionality in ``doc/index.rst``
* Telegram channels are always visible, which may become a problem on growing number of channels
