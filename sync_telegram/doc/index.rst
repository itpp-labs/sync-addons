The Telegram Bot API has a `limit <https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#inputfile>`__ on the files sent through the bot:
 - The operator cannot send to Telegram user more than **10 MB for photos** and **50 MB for other files**.
 - Also, the operator cannot receive **files larger than 20 MB** from a Telegram user.

In order to do that, subscribe corresponding channel to the record.
Use button ``Show Followers -> Add Channels``.
